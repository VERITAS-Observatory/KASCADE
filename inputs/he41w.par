!This is an genneric input file for Veritas at Kitt peak KASCADE. It specifies
! a Proton coming
!from  1 deg from zenith from the South,
!starting at a depth of .1 gm/cm**2 with on observatory height 
!of 1775 meters. Particles of down to 10 Mev kinetic energy are kept and are 
!propagated in step sizes of .02 radiation lengths (about .74 gm/cm**2).  The
!earths magnetic field is enabled with KittPeak  values and the particles 
!that reach the observation  altitude are not saved in a POG file.
