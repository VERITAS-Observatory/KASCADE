# Developmental. There are two shower direction 
# reconstruction methods available. Method0 uses the image 
# size as the weight. Method1 uses the Log10 of image sizeas 
# a weight 
CLR_Algorithm "Method1"

# There are currently four methods available, Methods 
# 0,3,4,5. Method 0 does a weighted minimisation of the 
# perpendicular distance of the source location to the image 
# axis where the weight is given by the image size. Method 3 
# does a weighted average of each pair of image axes where 
# the weight is given by the sin squared of the angle 
# between each pair of axes. Method 4 also uses a weighted 
# average of pairs of axes, where the weight is given by a 
# function involving the angle between the axes,the image 
# size, and the image ellipticity (ie width/length). Method 
# 5 takes the single-telescope disp method and averages the 
# single-telescope results, weighting by an uncertainty in 
# each telescope's predicted position that is derived from 
# simulations. It outperforms Method 0 at large zenith 
# angles.

# You can set which combinations of telescopes to allow/deny 
# post cuts. By default 'ALL' combinations are allowed. This 
# option lets you define combinations to deny; this option 
# is overridden by its partner option -TelCombosToAllow. If 
# you want to specify your own combinations, you can set 
# them using comma-separated options. Eg, if you want to cut 
# T1T4 events but allow all others you can specify 
# '-TelCombosToDeny=T1T4'. Or, if you want to cut any event 
# that includes T1 you can specify 
# '-TelCombosToDeny=T1T2,T1T3,T1T4,T1T2T3,T1T2T4,T1T3T4,T1T2T3T4. 
# The input will also understand ANY2, ANY3, ANY4, and ALL. 
# If you only want events that have all four telescopes, do

TelCombosToDeny 

# This option works in much the same way as -TelCombosToDeny 
# and takes the same type of string inputs. Combinations 
# allowed using this option override combinations denied
